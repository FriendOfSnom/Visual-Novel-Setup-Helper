"""
Legacy background removal implementation.

This module contains the original threshold-based background removal method
that was used before upgrading to ML-based removal (rembg).

Preserved for:
- Fallback when rembg is not available
- Comparison/testing purposes
- Users who prefer the simpler/faster method

def strip_background_legacy(image_bytes: bytes) -> bytes:
    """
    Strip a flat-ish magenta background using threshold-based color matching.

    This is the original implementation that uses border pixel sampling
    and Euclidean distance threshold to identify and remove background pixels.

    Strategy:
      1) Load RGBA.
      2) Collect all opaque border pixels.
      3) Estimate background color as the average of those border pixels.
      4) Clear any pixel sufficiently close to that background color.

    NOTE: This method has known limitations:
      - Can leave faint halos around edges
      - May remove character colors similar to background
      - Struggles with isolated background "pockets" in complex shapes

    For better quality, use the ML-based strip_background() method instead.

    Args:
        image_bytes: Input image as bytes

    Returns:
        Image bytes with background removed (transparent)
