This step shows all generated expressions for each outfit.

HOW THIS RELATES TO THE PREVIOUS STEP
The background removal settings (Tolerance/Depth) you set on the Outfit Review step were used to process these expressions. If backgrounds look good here, those settings worked well!

If backgrounds need work, use the "Remove BG" button below each expression to fix them individually.

IMPORTANT: You must review ALL outfits before proceeding.

TROUBLESHOOTING - WHEN TO REGENERATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGENERATE if you see any of these issues:

• Expression goes off-screen or is cropped weirdly
  The AI sometimes generates images that extend past the frame. Click "Regen" to try again.

• Bad framing / expression doesn't match others
  If one expression looks zoomed in/out differently, or the character is positioned differently, regenerate to get better consistency.

• Showing feet or different body position
  All expressions should match the base outfit's framing. If not, regenerate.

• Arm/body pixels look "eaten" or deleted
  This is caused by the automatic background removal (rembg) being too aggressive. You have two options:
  1. Click "Regen" - may produce a version that rembg handles better
  2. Use "Remove BG" to manually fix it (see below)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
HOW TO USE THE FLOOD FILL / TOUCH-UP TOOL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Click "Remove BG" to open the editor:

1. CLICK on background areas to remove them
   Each click removes a connected area of similar color (flood fill).

2. ADJUST TOLERANCE (slider at top)
   - Low tolerance (10-30): Only removes very similar colors
   - High tolerance (50-80): Removes a wider range of colors
   Start with lower values to avoid accidentally removing parts of the character.

3. Work from OUTSIDE IN
   Click on the main background area first, then work toward edges.

4. For FINE DETAILS (hair strands, edges):
   Lower the tolerance and click carefully on remaining spots.

5. RESTART button: Undoes ALL your changes and starts over.

6. Click ACCEPT when the background is fully removed.

Tip: If you switched to "Manual Mode" on the previous step because rembg was eating arm pixels, the "Remove BG" tool here will start from the original black-background image, letting you manually remove the background while preserving the full character.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

NAVIGATION
Use the "< Prev" and "Next >" buttons to switch between outfits.

The progress indicator shows:
- Current outfit number and name
- How many outfits you've viewed

The Next button is disabled until you've viewed every outfit at least once.

EXPRESSION CARDS
Each card shows one expression with its number and description.

Expression 0 (neutral) cannot be regenerated - it uses the outfit image directly and is the base for all other expressions.

REGENERATION
Click "Regen" on any expression (except 0) to generate a new version. The AI will create a different interpretation of that expression while keeping the same outfit.

BACKGROUND REMOVAL
Each expression has a "Remove BG" button that opens a click-based flood-fill editor.

The starting point depends on the outfit's mode from the previous step:
- Auto mode: Starts from the rembg-processed result (use to touch up remaining artifacts)
- Manual mode: Starts from the original black-background image (use for full manual removal)

For existing outfits in add-to-character mode, use the "Switch to Manual/Auto" button to toggle between modes.

WORKFLOW
1. Use Prev/Next to view each outfit's expressions
2. Regenerate any expressions that don't look right
3. Use "Remove BG" to fix any background issues you notice
4. Once all outfits are viewed, click Next

Note: Changes are saved automatically. You can go back and forth between outfits without losing work.

ADD-TO-EXISTING MODE
When adding expressions to existing outfits:
- Existing outfits appear in the dropdown with "existing_" prefix
- Expression 0 (the original neutral) is shown as a read-only reference
- Only the expressions you selected in Step 4 are generated
- New expressions are saved directly to the existing character folder
- The reference card has a darker background to indicate it's not editable"""
