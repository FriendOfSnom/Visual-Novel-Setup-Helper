# Visual Novel Development Toolkit (v2.0.0)

A comprehensive, AI-powered toolkit for creating visual novels with Ren'Py. This suite provides everything needed to create professional VN projects: from project setup and AI character generation to expression sheet creation.

Perfect for game developers, writers, and creators who want to build accessible visual novels with custom character systems.

---

## Three-Tool Workflow

### **Tool 1: Ren'Py Project Scaffolder**
Creates production-ready Ren'Py projects with custom character support.

**What it does:**
- Downloads Ren'Py SDK 8.5.0 automatically (if missing)
- Launches official Ren'Py launcher for project creation
- Injects custom character loading system
- Adds support for dynamic character positioning and expressions
- Optionally imports existing character folders
- Moves project to your chosen location

**Custom Features Added to Projects:**
- Auto-loads characters from `game/images/characters/` folder
- Custom position transforms: `centerleft`, `centerright`, `faceleft`, `faceright`
- Automatic character voice and color support
- Dynamic outfit and expression swapping
- Support for character metadata via `character.yml` files

---

### **Tool 2: Gemini Character Creator**
AI-powered character sprite generator using Google Gemini vision models.

**What it does:**
- Generate character sprites from text prompts or reference images
- Create multiple expressions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.)
- Generate multiple outfits (casual, uniform, etc.)
- Automatically crop and scale sprites
- Create game-ready folder structures
- Generate `character.yml` metadata files

**Output Format:**
```
character_name/
├── character.yml          # Metadata (voice, scale, colors)
└── a/                     # Pose folder (letter poses)
    ├── faces/
    │   └── face/
    │       ├── happy.png
    │       ├── sad.png
    │       ├── angry.png
    │       └── neutral.png
    └── outfits/
        ├── casual.png
        └── uniform.png
```

**Integration:**
Characters created with Tool 2 are automatically compatible with projects created by Tool 1. Simply copy character folders to `game/images/characters/` and they'll load automatically!

---

### **Tool 3: Visual Scene Editor** (Planned)
A complete GUI-based scene editor for writing visual novels without code.

**What it will do:**
- Live preview window showing the current scene in real-time
- Drag-and-drop character positioning on screen
- Visual selectors for expressions, outfits, backgrounds, and sounds
- Dialogue editor with character selection dropdown
- Automatic expression sheet generation and display
- Preset position buttons (left, centerleft, center, centerright, right)
- Flip controls (faceleft, faceright)
- Transition selector for character entrances/exits
- Forward/back arrows to navigate scene timeline (undo/redo)
- "Next" button to generate and append Ren'Py code to script.rpy

**Vision:**
This tool will enable non-programmers to create complete visual novels using an intuitive GUI interface, automatically generating proper Ren'Py script code behind the scenes.

---

## Quick Start

### First-Time Setup

#### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Windows
start-windows.bat

# macOS
./start-mac.command
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all required packages.

#### 2. Download Ren'Py SDK (Required for Tool 1)
The toolkit will prompt you to download the SDK when you first run Tool 1. Alternatively, you can download it manually:

```bash
python download_renpy_sdk.py
```

This downloads Ren'Py SDK 8.5.0 (~150 MB) to the toolkit folder.

---

## Requirements

* **Python 3.10 or higher**
* **Google Gemini API Key** (for Tool 2 - Character Creator)
  - Get your free API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
  - Set environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Python Dependencies
Installed automatically via launcher scripts:
```
google-generativeai
pillow>=10.3
pyyaml
requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas
rembg  # Optional: for background removal experiments
```

---

## Usage

### Running the Toolkit

**Windows:**
```bash
start-windows.bat
```

**macOS:**
```bash
./start-mac.command
```

This launches the main menu where you can select:
1. **Create new Ren'Py project** (Tool 1 - Project Scaffolder)
2. **Create new character sprites** (Tool 2 - Gemini Character Creator)
3. **Generate expression sheets** (Utility tool)
Q. Quit

**Note:** Tool 3 (Visual Scene Editor) is planned for future implementation.

    alice "Hello! Nice to meet you!"

    # Change expression
    show alice casual sad
    alice "I'm feeling a bit down today..."

    # Flip character to face left
    show alice at faceleft
    alice "Looking this way!"

    # Change outfit
    show alice uniform neutral at centerleft
    alice "Ready for school!"
```

   - Windows: Double-click `renpy.exe`
   - Mac/Linux: Run `./renpy.sh`

2. **Select Your Project:**
   - Your project will appear in the left panel
   - Click on your project name to select it

3. **Launch the Game:**
   - Click the **"Launch Project"** button
   - Your game will start in a new window

### During Development

**Testing Changes:**
- Save your script file
- Press **Shift+R** in the running game to reload
- Or restart the game from the SDK launcher

**Common Shortcuts in Game:**
- `Shift+R` - Reload game (after script changes)
- `Shift+D` - Developer menu

- `faceleft`, `faceright` - Flip character sprites horizontally

**Character Methods (in script.rpy):**
```python
# Access character objects
alice.outfit = "uniform"           # Change outfit
alice.add_accessory("glasses")     # Add accessory
alice.remove_accessory("hat")      # Remove accessory
```

**Character YAML Format:**
```yaml
display_name: "Alice"
name_color: "#ff69b4"
scale: 0.85
voice: "girl"
eye_line: 0.42
default_outfit: "casual"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Ren'Py SDK not found!"
- Run Tool 1 and select "Yes" when prompted to download the SDK
- Or manually run: `python download_renpy_sdk.py`

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"
- Get your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Set environment variable before running:
  ```bash
  # Windows (CMD)
  set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

  # Windows (PowerShell)
  $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

  # macOS/Linux
  export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  ```

### Characters not loading in game
- Verify folder structure matches Tool 2 output format
- Check that characters are in `game/images/characters/`
- Ensure `character.yml` exists in character folder
- Launch game and check console for error messages

### Tkinter errors on macOS
- Ensure you're using Homebrew Python (not system Python)
- The `start-mac.command` script handles this automatically
